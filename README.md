## üçø Plex Settings
Before downloading Movie themes, make sure your [Plex settings](https://support.plex.tv/articles/200220717-local-media-assets-tv-shows/) are correct. </br>
If using the new Plex TV Series agent you only need to enable ‚ÄúUse local Assets‚Äù in the libraries settings.
For each client, you need to enable "Play Theme Music"

>[!Note]
> Gdrive has pretty low rate limits. You'll only be able to download about 30 themes at once.
> Therefor I suggest you simply go to [the Gdrive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/128O8hwhxmPppwJ3ssGKQoepMrKLB5tNA), manually download all themes and paste them into your Movie directory.
> You can then schedule the script to search for new additions. If you choose to let the script handle all themes, keep in mind this may take a long time due to the rate limit timeouts.

## üöÄ Usage - Running the Script

Open a Terminal in your script directory and launch the script with:
```sh
python TDFP.py
```


The script will:
- Connect to your Plex server and fetch all movies
- Scan the Google Drive folder for movie themes
- Check which movies have matching themes on the Gdrive that haven't been downloaded yet
- Download themes to the correct locations
- Refresh Plex metadata for the updated movies (this is necessary for Plex to detect the Themes.



If the script hits Google Drive API rate limits, it will:
- Save its current state
- Wait for the cooldown period specified in the config
- Automatically resume where it left off

>[!TIP]
>Windows users can create a batch file to quickly launch the script.<br/>
>Type "[path to your python.exe]" "[path to the script]" into a text editor
>
>For example:
>```
>"C:\Users\User1\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe" "P:\TDFP\TDFP.py"
>pause
>```
>Save as a .bat file. You can now double click this batch file to directly launch the script.

## üïµÔ∏è Check.py
Sometimes Plex fails to pick up a local file (in this case theme.mp3) even after refreshing the metadata.
I have included a script (check.py) that checks your Plex and local folders to find any themes that exist but weren't picked up by Plex.
You can run `python check.py` to check if all themes are correctly picked up by Plex.

## ‚ùì FAQ

Q: Why do I need a Google API key?  
A: The script uses the Google Drive API to access and download theme files. The API key allows authenticated access to Google's services.


Q: How does the script match movies?  
A: The script first tries to find exact matches between your Plex movie titles and the Google Drive folders. If that fails, it uses fuzzy matching with a 70% similarity threshold, while ensuring years match if available.


Q: What happens if Google Drive rate limits me?  
A: The script will save its current state, wait for the cooldown period specified in your config (RETRY_COOLDOWN), and then automatically resume where it left off.
